FFI bindings & NativePort event callback handling for `dart_vlc.dll`.

Dependency package for [dart_vlc](https:///github.com/alexmercerind/dart_vlc).

## Example

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:io';

import 'package:dart_vlc_ffi/dart_vlc.dart';


void main(List<String> args) {
  /// Initialize the library, pass path to dart_vlc.so or dart_vlc.dll
  DartVLC.initialize(dynamicLibraryPath);

  /// Create a new player. Provide an ID to handle multiple players.
  Player player = Player(
    id: 0,
    /// Pass commandline VLC arguments.
    commandlineArguments: [],
  );

  /// Listen to events on the player e.g. position, rate, volume etc.
  /// Same can be accessed directly in the class without having to use the stream.

  player.generalStream.listen((event) {
    /// Player's rate.
    print('Rate of the player is ${event.rate}');
    /// Player's volume.
    print('Volume of the player is ${event.volume}');
  });

  player.positionStream.listen((event) {
    /// Player's current media playback position.
    print('Position of the player is ${event.position}');
    /// Player's current media playback duration.
    print('Duration of the player is ${event.duration}');
  });

  player.currentStream.listen((event) {
    /// Index of the currently playing media.
    print('Current media index of the player is ${event.index}');
    /// Currently playing media.
    print('Current playing media is ${event.media}');
    /// All the medias in the playlist.
    print('Current playing media is ${event.medias}');
    /// Whether current playback is a playlist or not.
    print('Current playing media is ${event.isPlaylist}');
  });

  player.playbackStream.listen((event) {
    print('isPlaying   :${event.isPlaying}');
    print('isSeekable  :${event.isSeekable}');
    print('isCompleted :${event.isCompleted}');
  });

  player.setRate(1.25);

  player.setVolume(1.0);

  /// Create a new media using a URL.
  Media media = Media.network(
    Uri.parse('https:///www.soundhelix.com/examples/mp3/SoundHelix-Song-1.mp3'),
    /// Pass parse as true for accessing the metadata.
    parse: true
  );
  /// Get media's metadata.
  print(media.metas);

  /// Open the media into the player. You can also open a Playlist instead of a media.
  player.open(media);

  Timer(Duration(seconds: 10), () {
    /// Alter playback rate.
    player.setRate(1.25);
    /// Alter playback volume.
    player.setVolume(0.5);
  });
  
  Timer(Duration(seconds: 20), () {
    /// Pause the player.
    player.pause();
    Timer(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
      /// Resume the player.
      player.play();
      
    });
  });

  /// A lot lot of other options like device enumeration & changing, equalizer, recording, broadcasting, chromecasting etc. are also available.
}
```
